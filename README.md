# dFusion Vana Miner

## vpsl-miner

Replace config.json with config-dev.json for local development.

## dev

The projects have been set up to serve the renderer app and electron app. Use:

```sh
npx nx serve electron
```

The renderer app may only finish after the electron app. In the electron app's dev tools console, run:

```
location.reload()
```

## build

The following command builds both apps and then packages the electron app:

```
npx nx package electron
```

To create the executables (windows .exe, mac .dmg, ...), run:

```
npx nx run electron:make
```

## macOS Code Signing

To distribute your app on macOS, you'll need to code sign and notarize it. Follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. An active Apple Developer account
2. Apple Developer ID certificate
3. App-specific password for your Apple ID

### Configuration

1. Get your Developer ID certificate from Apple Developer Portal
2. Find your Team ID in the Apple Developer Portal (Membership details)
3. Update the `package.json` file with your signing details:

```json
"mac": {
  "hardenedRuntime": true,
  "gatekeeperAssess": false,
  "entitlements": "apps/electron/build/entitlements.mac.plist",
  "entitlementsInherit": "apps/electron/build/entitlements.mac.plist",
  "identity": "Developer ID Application: Your Company Name (YOUR_TEAM_ID)",
  "notarize": {
    "teamId": "YOUR_TEAM_ID"
  }
}
```

4. Set up environment variables for notarization:

```sh
export APPLE_ID=your.apple.id@example.com
export APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
```

5. Build the application with code signing:

```sh
export APPLE_ID="your.apple.id@example.com"
export APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD="xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
export APPLE_TEAM_ID="xxxxxxxx"
export CSC_LINK="~/Keys/certificate.p12"
export CSC_KEY_PASSWORD="xxxxxxxxxxxx"
npx nx package electron
npx nx make electron
```

### Troubleshooting

- If code signing fails, check your certificate is valid and accessible in Keychain Access
- Ensure the entitlements file has the correct permissions configured
- For notarization issues, check Apple's developer documentation or logs

## Auto-Updater Configuration

The application uses electron-updater with S3 as the update provider. The update configuration can be customized using environment variables.

### Environment Variables

Configure the following environment variables to customize the update feed:

- `UPDATE_FEED_BUCKET`: S3 bucket name (default: 'dfusionai')
- `UPDATE_FEED_PATH`: Path within the bucket (default: '/updates')
- `UPDATE_FEED_REGION`: AWS region (default: 'ap-southeast-1')

### Configuration Example

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```sh
UPDATE_FEED_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
UPDATE_FEED_PATH=/your-path
UPDATE_FEED_REGION=your-region
```

### Update Behavior

The auto-updater is configured with the following settings:
- Automatic downloads enabled
- Updates install on application quit
- Only stable releases are allowed (no pre-releases)
- Downgrades are disabled for security

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/angular-monorepo-tutorial?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve vpsl-miner
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build vpsl-miner
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project vpsl-miner
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)


## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/angular:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/angular:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Set up CI!

### Step 1

To connect to Nx Cloud, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx connect
```

Connecting to Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Step 2

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
npx nx g ci-workflow
```
